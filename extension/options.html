<h3>Extension Update Disabler</h3>
<p>Chrome automatically updates your extensions.  There have been occasions where an extension developer
has lost/sold control of his extension to a malware author.  Or maybe you just want to control when
updates hit your system.

The <em>Extension Update Disabler</em> extension empowers you to enable/disable automatic updates of
your Chrome extensions.
</p>
<br/>
<p>Note: If you use this extension, it becomes <em>your</em> responsibility to ensure that security updates
get installed on your system to prevent breaches.</p>
<br/>
Current status of auto-update is: <b><span id="update-status">unknown</span></b>
<br/>
<br/>
<button id="pbDisableAutoUpdate">Disable auto-update</button>
<button id="pbEnableAutoUpdate" >Enable auto-update</button>
<button id="pbListExtensions" > List Extensions</button>
<br/>
<ul id="extensionList">
</ul>
<br/>
<span id= "helper-instructions">This extension requires you to install a separate 'helper' application from <a href="http://kleinfelter.com/update-disabler/">this page</a>.</span>
<br/>
Helper status is: <span id="plugin-found">unknown</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Chrome does not allow extensions to alter the auto-update behavior of other extension directly, so you install a
separate executable 'helper' app on your local system, and that helper app updates your extensions to be unable to
auto-update themselves.  After you install the helper, you can close and reopen this extension in order to 'see' the helper.
<br/><br/>
If you install new extensions after disabling auto-updates, those new extensions will be ENABLED.  (That's how they got installed.)
Disabling extensions just marks currently installed extensions disabled -- it does not monitor for newly installed extensions.
If you want new extentions to be disabled, you must come here and disable auto-update after installing them.
